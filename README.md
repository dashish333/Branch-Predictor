# Branch-Predictor
Branch Predictor Implementation in C++
This code is basically a branch predictor implementation for analyses purpose, where one is suppose to compare the mis-prediction rate of different branch predictors known to us i.e 1-bit bimodal, 2-bit bimodal, correlating predictor

The simulator is very generalized and has the capacity to compute the mis-prediction rate depenig upon users requirement.
Please review code for more details!!

Please  note that input ot file is:
1. Trace file containing <hex address,T or NT> types of entries in each line
2.command line input of the type of predictor you wanna chose in format (m,n) without parenthesis
